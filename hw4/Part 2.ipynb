    "When solving some problem with deep learning in practice, you search the Web for the latest paper on that problem, and take its implementation from GitHub. However, often authors won't publish code, so being able to **reimplement a paper** is a vital skill. You will likely have to do it in your course project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we'll simulate reimplementing a paper (in a greatly simplified environment though). As in many papers, some details of the system may be omitted so you'll have to leverage intution and guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that there's already some great intuition on the Web (similar papers, Reddit, GitHub...). For example, if you have difficulties optimizing Transformer, it's not just you: googling \"*transformer training diverges*\" will show discussions and even papers just on Transformer training tricks. Still, **cite any foreign code** that you use (although this time you'll likely won't need any)."

    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoder** converts raw phonemes to their representations that include context. It's inspired by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10352) and is a stack of Transformer encoder layers and convolutions. In contrast to that paper, we don't use layer normalization; instead, we replace 1D convolution with full residual blocks where batch normalization is done. We use additive learned positional embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duration model** takes encoder's rich phoneme representations and predicts the duration of each phoneme in spectrogram frames. It's a a recurrent network that's trained independently and only after the rest of the system has been trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alignment model** \"upsamples\" phoneme embeddings according to their durations to match the output spectrogram shape. It employs Gaussian upsampling introduced in [\"Non-Attentive Tacotron\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04301) (section 3.1). The difference is that we learn the single $\\sigma$ for all inputs, and we compute PDFs at a more natural $t+0.5$ rather than at $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decoder** starts identical to encoder — with multi-head attention and convolutional blocks interleaved — except the smaller dropout rate. We even inject positional encodings again because the sequence length is now different and has a new meaning. After that, we predict the final spectrogram, imposing supervision at this point already. However, we found out that learnable post-processing greatly benefits quality, so we run the *post-processing network* that predicts a correction (residual) to be added to the above spectrogram. As a result, the output is supervised with a combination of two losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's important to not compute loss on the padded parts (both for spectrograms and durations) and to average it properly afterwards.\n",
    "* Outputs and targets, especially durations, can take values uncomfortable for the neural network which can lead to poor quality of divergence. Therefore, they need to be carefully normalized.\n",
    "* Recurrent nets and transformers tend to be unstable in training. It's important to [clip gradients](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_), use a suitable learning rate schedule (like \"Noam warmup\" for Transformers) and possibly employ other common tricks.\n",
    "* For speed, it's critical that Gaussian sampling implementation is fully vectorized, i.e. **all** parts of it run on GPU and don't use Python loops.\n",
    "* Because for one phoneme sequence there can be many correct spectrograms, pointwise spectrogram loss isn't fully representative of actual audio quality. We have noticed that even if the validation loss increases, the quality may still improve."

    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* Track failures early. Stop bad experiments early. Test one new thing at once.\n",
    "* Don't use code from part 1, use built-in PyTorch Transformer blocks.\n",
    "* Large batches aren't always good. Especially if you have a tight deadline and Colab time limits.\n",
    "* Send audio to TensorBoard (or whatever is your favourite logging tool).\n",
    "* If you're on a GPU that natively supports mixed precision training (e.g. T4, P100, V100, RTX, GTX 16), you're lucky. Mixed precision training is built into PyTorch and speeds training up almost for free.\n",
    "* Batches of too uneven lengths waste computations on padded parts. The technique known as \"bucketing\" can help."
